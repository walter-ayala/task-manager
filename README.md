# Task manager

A React project with TypeScript created using Vite, about a task manager allows you to browse, add and delete tasks to users and watch your profile information.
I implemented luxon, styled-components, graphql with Apollo client and also i used Standard with TypeScript.

I chose that folder structure because I consider that it facilitates the classification and search of files, 
because it is very intuitive to find or know what each folder contains. inside the api, components and hooks folders, 
I created a folder that contains what each of the screens needs, in hooks it was not necessary to create the Dashboard folder 
but I did it thinking at once in case the project would grow and need new modules or pages. Also I separate the functions and components so that each one is responsible for a specific function.

# Setup/Running instructions

In the project directory, you must run "npm install", to install dependencies

Then you can run "npm run dev" to runs the app in the development mode.
